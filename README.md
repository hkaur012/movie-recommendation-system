# Recommendation Systems

## Description

The goal of this project is to use the basic recommendation principles we have learned for user-collected data. 

### Dataset
The MovieLens datasets were collected by the [GroupLens Research Project](https://grouplens.org/) at the University of Minnesota during the seven-month period from September 19, 1997 through April 22, 1998.  We are using the "100k dataset", available from
https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/

There are three files that we will use:

1.  u.data: 100,000 ratings by 943 users on 1682 movies. Each user has rated at least 20 movies. Users and items are numbered
consecutively from 1. The data is randomly ordered. This is a tab separated list of 

```
user id   item id   rating    timestamp
```

The timestamps are Unix seconds since 1/1/1970 UTC.

Example:
```
196     242     3       881250949
186     302     3       891717742
22      377     1       878887116
244     51      2       880606923
166     346     1       886397596
298     474     4       884182806
115     265     2       881171488
```

2.  u.item: Information about the 1682 movies. This is a tab separated list of

```
movie id | movie title | release date | video release date | IMDb URL | unknown | Action | Adventure | Animation |Children's | Comedy | Crime | Documentary | Drama | Fantasy | Film-Noir | Horror | Musical | Mystery | Romance | Sci-Fi | Thriller | War | Western |
```

The last 19 fields are the genres, a 1 indicates the movie is of that genre, a 0 indicates it is not; movies can be in several genres
at once. The movie ids are the ones used in the u.data dataset. 

Example:

```
161|Top Gun (1986)|01-Jan-1986||http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Top%20Gun%20(1986)|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0 
162|On Golden Pond (1981)|01-Jan-1981||http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?On%20Golden%20Pond%20(1981)|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0 
163|Return of the Pink Panther, The (1974)|01-Jan-1974||http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Return%20of%20the%20Pink%20Panther,%20The%20(1974)|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0| 0|0|0|0|0
```

3.  u.user: Demographic information about the users. This is a tab separated list of:

```
user id | age | gender | occupation | zip code
```

The user ids are the ones used in the u.data dataset.

Example:
```
1|24|M|technician|85711 
2|53|F|other|94043 
3|23|M|writer|32067 
4|24|M|technician|43537 
5|33|F|other|15213
```

### Example Code
Instead of writing code from scratch, you are encouraged to modify the code from Ch 2 of *Programming Collective Intelligence* that performs movie recommendations from the MovieLens dataset.  Note that there is code that we did not go over in class (contained in `recommendations.py`) that reads in the u.data and u.item files. 

Main source: https://github.com/arthur-e/Programming-Collective-Intelligence/blob/master/chapter2/recommendations.py

*You do not have to write a single Python script that answers all of the questions (think modular!). You do not have write Python code for every operation. If you can answer questions using Unix commands, do so, but include the commands and describe what you did.*

## Questions

**Q1.**  Find 3 users who are closest to you in terms of age, gender, and occupation.  

For each of those 3 users:
* what are their top 3 (favorite) films?
* what are their bottom 3 (least favorite) films?

Based on the movie values in those 6 tables (3 users X (favorite + least favorite)), choose a user that you feel is most like you.  Feel 
free to note any outliers (e.g., "I mostly identify with user 123, except I did not like "Ghost" at all").  You can investigate more than just the top 3 and bottom 3 movies to find your best match.

This user is the *substitute you*.  

**Q2.**  Which 5 users are most correlated to the *substitute you*? Which 5 users are least correlated (i.e., negative correlation)?

**Q3.**  Compute ratings for all the films that the *substitute you* has not seen.  

Provide a list of the top 5 recommendations for films that the *substitute you* should see.  

Provide a list of the bottom 5 recommendations (i.e., films the *substitute you* is almost certain to hate).

**Q4.**  Choose your (the real you, not the *substitute you*) favorite and least favorite film from the data.  For each film, generate a list of the top 5 most correlated and bottom 5 least correlated films. 

Based on your knowledge of the resulting films, do you agree with the results?  In other words, do you personally like / dislike the resulting films?

## Extra Credit

**Q5.** *(Extra credit, 4 points)*  Rank all 1682 movies according to the 1997/1998 MovieLens data.  (*Rank*, not rate. These should be 1-1682.) Break any ties based on number of raters (for example, 7.2 with 10,000 raters > 7.2 with 9,000 raters).

Now rank the same 1682 movies according to [today's IMDB data](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/).  Note that the IMDB data includes TV shows and other items that aren't movies.

Draw a scatterplot where each dot is a film (i.e., 1682 dots).  The x-axis is the MovieLens ranking and the y-axis is today's IMDB
ranking.

## Submission

Make sure that you have committed and pushed your local repo to GitHub before the deadline.  

*You do not need to submit anything to Blackboard.*
